**<h1>User Interface Design Project Idea:</h1>**

For my project, I am creating an app where personal trainers can post workout routines and food recipes to their profiles, and athletes can follow them to get updates on whatever routines and diets they are focusing on currently.  An athlete may post a review of the trainer, which shows up on their public profile page for others to view.  All website users are able to view things posted by trainers and athletes.
